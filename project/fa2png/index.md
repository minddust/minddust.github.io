[fa2png](http://fa2png.io/) is a Font-Awesome-To-PNG-Online-Converter. Nothing more to say =)


Well.. maybe a little bit.

A [friend](http://jannikweyrich.com/) of mine came up with the idea of this online-icon-font-to-image-generation-tool.

There are services like [flaticon.com](http://www.flaticon.com/) but he wanted something else:

* easy simple setup
* possibility to choose different sizes
* possibility to choose different colors
* plain font-awesome

So after a 12 hour hackathon we came up with [fa2png.io](http://fa2png.io/)

Yea! That's it. Hope you like it.
